## Biotropyd

"Only entropy comes easy" -- Anton Chekhov

Unless you are a computer, in that case entropy is imposible to generate from your own deterministic processes alone. Most operating systems have to resort to noise generated somewhere in the computer system to feed their entropy pools.

Humans, on the other hand, are an excellent source of entropy. You are older now than you were when you started reading this text. This process of decay is relentless, stochastic and perfectly natural as well as unstoppable.

Most biological processes are cyclical in nature so all biological systems have internal clocks to time them. Circadian rhythms, heart beats, sleeping cycles, Apoptosis (programmed cell death) are a few examples of timed processes that take place within you every day and repeat themselves at more or less precise intervals.

Biotropyd is a simple software experiment that feeds the entropy pool in your computer with your heartrate and generates your cryptographic identity using the randomness generated from that pool. Thereby linking your digital identity to a bodily process that uniquely identifies you.
